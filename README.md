# plasma_GCA_2023
Analysis of plasma proteins in Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) patients compared with healthy controls.
===================================================

This repository includes Jupyter lab notebooks to run for the analysis for this project. 
The input data is included in the repository; no editing is required to run the scripts. 
Each script has local data that is read in, and all output for the figures is automatically 
put into the corresponding output directory.

The scripts included are the following:

>quantile_normalization.ipynb

This script takes the raw RFU data from SomaLogic and quantile normalizes the samples.
A box plot of all samples is provided at the end of the script to confirm that all samples
have the same distribution and median after quantile normalization. The quantile normalized 
data is saved in the data directory for all downstream analysis.

>PCA.ipynb

This script takes the quantile normalized data and makes a PCA plot in R. Additionally, this
script makes box plots of the distribution of PC1 and PC2 values for all three study groups
(Active GCA, Inactive GCA, and Healthy controls). A Mannâ€“Whitney U test was used to compare 
the PC1 and PC2 distributions between all three study groups, the *P*-values are provided and
denoted between each group.



The Clinical Disease Activity score is a commonly used RA measurement of disease
severity. In this script, the CDAI scores are used with the quantile normalized data
to find Spearman Correlations. The autoantibody with the highest Spearman Correlation is
for the CISH gene.

# Installation

There are a few R libraries that need to be installed to run these scripts.
They are:

```
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(ggpubr)
library(Hmisc)
library(preprocessCore)
library(effsize)
library(pheatmap)
library(FactoMineR)
library(stats)
library(factoextra)
library(ggfortify)
```

NOTE: You must make a directory called "output" in the same directory as all the scripts and files.
This is where the figures will be saved.

Here is an example of running the scripts:

> Rscript differentially_abundant_final.r
