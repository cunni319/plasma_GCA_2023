This repository includes Jupyter lab notebooks to run for the analysis of this project. The input data is included in the repository; 
no editing is required to run the scripts. Each script has local data that is read in, and all output for the figures is automatically 
put into the corresponding output directory.

The scripts included are the following:

## Data Preprocessing

>../src/quantile_normalization/quantile_normalization.ipynb

This script takes the raw RFU data from SomaLogic, and quantile normalizes the samples. A box plot of all samples is provided at the end 
of the script to illustrate that all samples have the same distribution and median after quantile normalization. The quantile normalized 
data is saved in the data directory for all downstream analysis.


## Exploratory analysis
>../src/Figure_1B_C_D/PCA.ipynb

This script takes the quantile normalized data and makes a PCA plot in R. Additionally, this script makes box plots of the distribution of 
PC1 and PC2 values for all three study groups (Active GCA, Inactive GCA, and Healthy controls). A Mannâ€“Whitney *U* test was used to compare 
the PC1 and PC2 distributions between all three study groups. The *P*-values are provided and denoted between each group.


>../src/Figure_1B_C_D/linear_modeling_between_PC1_and_demographic_variables.ipynb

This script uses the quantile normalized data to do PCA analysis. The PC1 values for all three study groups are saved for linear modeling. 
Linear regression models were constructed between clinical and demographic variables for all three study groups. This includes the Study group,
age, prednisone use, BMI, aspirin use, sex, PGA, Smoking status, and CRP. Each clinical and demographic variable had an individual linear 
regression model constructed. The *P*-value and the R<sup>2</sup> for the variable of interest are saved to make a lollipop plot with the length 
of the line representing the linear regression model *P*-value and the size of the point representing the R<sup>2</sup> value.

## Differential abundance analysis
>../src/linear_modeling_active_and_controls/linear_modeling_active_and_controls.ipynb

This script uses the quantile normalized data as well as the clinical and demographic data to build linear regression models between Active GCA 
patients and Healthy controls. Marginal linear regression models were run on six clinical and demographic variables (age, smoking status, sex, 
prednisone use, aspirin use, and methotrexate use) between Active GCA and Healthy controls. Variables with linear regression model *P*-values < 
0.05 were identified as significant confounders and included in the full multiple linear regression models. In the full multiple linear regression
models, the *P*-value from the study group variable was used to identify differentially abundant proteins between Active GCA and Healthy controls. 
A threshold of *P* < 0.01 was applied to all plasma proteins for significance.


>../src/linear_modeling_inactive_and_controls/linear_modeling_inactive_and_controls.ipynb

This script uses the quantile normalized data as well as the clinical and demographic data to build linear regression models between Inactive GCA 
patients and Healthy controls. Marginal linear regression models were run on six clinical and demographic variables (age, smoking status, sex,
prednisone use, aspirin use, and methotrexate use) between Inactive GCA and Healthy controls. Variables with linear regression model *P*-values < 0.05 
were identified as significant confounders and included in the full multiple linear regression models. In the full multiple linear regression models,
the *P*-value from the study group variable was used to identify differentially abundant proteins between Inactive GCA and Healthy controls. A threshold
of *P* < 0.01 was applied to all plasma proteins for significance.

>../src/linear_modeling_active_and_inactive/linear_modeling_active_and_inactive_GCA.ipynb

This script uses the quantile normalized data as well as the clinical and demographic data to build linear regression models between Inactive GCA patients
and Healthy controls. Marginal random effect linear regression models were run on six clinical and demographic variables (age, smoking status, sex, prednisone
use, aspirin use, and methotrexate use)between Active GCA and Inactive GCA. Variables with random effect linear regression model *P*-values < 0.05 were 
identified as significant confounders and included in the full random effect linear regression models. In the full random effect linear regression models,
the *P*-value from the study group variable was used to identify differentially abundant proteins between Active GCA and Inactive GCA. A threshold of *P* < 0.01 
was applied to all plasma proteins for significance.

>../src/Figure2_A_B_C_D_E/linear_modeling_summary.ipynb

This script reads the results from the multiple linear regression models between Active GCA and Healthy controls as well as for Inactive GCA and Healthy controls.
It presents the number of significant proteins (*P* < 0.01) for both group comparisons. Additionally, it provides how many proteins are higher or lower in 
both group comparisons (*i.e.,*, Active GCA vs. Healthy controls and Inactive GCA vs. Healthy controls) as well as how many overlap between the two groups. 
These results are denoted in Figures 2A and B.

>../src/Figure2_A_B_C_D_E/active_GCA_vs_healthy_controls_heatmap.ipynb

This script reads in the multiple linear regression model results between Active GCA and Healthy controls. It gathers the proteins from Active GCA and Healthy 
control and makes a heatmap after doing a z-score transformation on the data. Age, sex, smoking status, and BMI are denoted at the top of each heatmap for 
each study participant.

>../src/Figure2_A_B_C_D_E/inactive_GCA_vs_healthy_controls_heatmap.ipynb

This script reads in the multiple linear regression model results between Inactive GCA and Healthy controls. It gathers the proteins from Inactive GCA and 
Healthy controls and makes a heatmap after doing a z-score transformation on the data. Age, sex, smoking status, and BMI are denoted at the top of each 
heatmap for each study participant.

>../src/Figure2_A_B_C_D_E/active_GCA_vs_inactive_GCA_heatmap.ipynb

This script reads in the random effect linear regression model results between Active GCA and Inactive GCA. It gathers the proteins from Active GCA and Inactive
GCA and makes a heatmap after doing a z-score transformation on the data. Age, sex, smoking status, and BMI are denoted at the top of each heatmap for each 
study participant.


## Significant enriched GO Biological Processes
>../src/Figure3_A_B_C_D/top_20_GO_terms_from_DAVID.ipynb

This script reads the results from using the online bioinformatics tool DAVID to identify significantly enriched Biological Processes for differentially abundant
proteins. There are four groups of proteins that were submitted to DAVID:
  1. Differentially abundant proteins higher in Active GCA compared to Healthy controls
  2. Differentially abundant proteins lower in Active GCA compared to Healthy controls
  3. Differentially abundant proteins higher in Inactive GCA compared to Healthy controls
  4. Differentially abundant protein lower in Inactive GCA compared to Healthy controls
     
A *P*-value < 0.01 from a modified Fisher's exact test provided by DAVID was used as a threshold for significance. This script orders all Biological Processes
based on their *P*-values and plots the top 20 most significant GO Biological Processes for each group of differentially abundant proteins. The script makes 
four bar graphs with the length of the bars as the *P*-value significance and shade representing the fold-enrichment.


## Proteins associated with PGA and CRP
>../src/Figure4_A_B/volcano_plot_with_PGA.ipynb

The Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) is a commonly used GCA measurement for disease severity in patients. This script uses the Active GCA plasma proteins 
and the Active GCA patients' clinical and demographic data to identify proteins associated with PGA in Active GCA patients. Marginal linear regression models
were constructed between all proteins and six clinical and demographic variables (age, smoking status, sex, prednisone use, aspirin use, and methotrexate use).
Variables with a *P*-value < 0.05 were included in the full multiple linear regression model between protein abundance and PGA. After constructing the linear 
regression models, Spearman rho values, along with their corresponding *P*-values, were calculated between proteins and PGA. All proteins with a *P*-value 
< 0.05 and an |Spearman rho| > 0.4 were identified as significant associations. A volcano plot is made at the very end, with the proteins of interest 
highlighted in colors (blue and red).

>../src/Figure4_A_B/volcano_plot_with_CRP.ipynb

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a blood-based protein that reflects systemic inflammation. This script uses the Active GCA plasma proteins 
and the Active GCA patients' clinical and demographic data to identify proteins associated with CRP in Active GCA patients. Marginal linear regression models
were constructed between all proteins and six clinical and demographic variables (age, smoking status, sex, prednisone use, aspirin use, and methotrexate use).
Variables with a *P*-value < 0.05 were included in the full multiple linear regression model between protein abundance and CRP. After constructing the linear 
regression models, Spearman rho values, along with their corresponding *P*-values, were calculated between proteins and CRP. All proteins with a *P*-value 
< 0.05 and an |Spearman rho| > 0.4 were identified as significant associations. A volcano plot is made at the very end, with the proteins of interest 
highlighted in colors (blue and red).

## Machine learning

The scripts for machine learning between Active GCA and Healthy controls and Inactive GCA and Healthy controls are the same except for the input data.

> 01_make_10fold_dataset.ipynb

This script reads all data for GCA (Active or Inactive) and Healthy controls and makes 10 train and test sets. Each train set has 54 total samples, and each test set has 6 samples. Each sample will be held out as a test sample once.

> 02_finding_differentially_abundant_proteins.ipynb

This script reads in each training set and constructs linear regression models between GCA (Active or Inactive) and Healthy controls. It saves the results of the linear regression models to use for feature selection.

> 03_making_train_and_test_sets_from_linear_modeling.ipynb

This script reads the results from the linear regression models and selects the proteins that were statistically significant between 
GCA (Active or Inactive) and Healthy controls. It saves all train and test sets using different thresholds for the number of proteins 
ranging from 10â€“250 proteins.

> 04_random_forest_classifier.ipynb

This script reads in the train and test sets to build a random forest classifier between GCA (Active or Inactive) and
Healthy controls. Each of the 10 train and test sets is read into the classifier once.

> 05_differentially_abundant_and_absolute_value_proteins_random_forest_results.ipynb

This script reads the results for all of the random forest classifier models used. The thresholds used
are the top: 10 proteins, 25 proteins, 50 proteins, 100 proteins, 150 proteins, 200 proteins, 250 proteins,
and all 7,289 proteins. Using the results, the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV)
and negative predictive value (NPV) are all calculated and provided.
